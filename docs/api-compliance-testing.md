# API compliance testing

Beyond the regular pytest suite (see [Running tests]), potto's OpenAPI document and running instances are checked
by three complementary, more specialized tools. Each catches a different class of problem, and all three run in
CI, on every pull request:

| Tool | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| [spectral] | API style and security conventions on the OpenAPI document itself |
| [ogcapi-registry] | Whether the API actually implements what it declares to conform to |
| [ogc-cite-runner] | Official OGC compliance test suites (TeamEngine) |

[Running tests]: development.md#running-tests


## Spectral: API style and security linting

potto uses [spectral] to lint the OpenAPI document itself against a custom ruleset (`spectral/spectral.yaml`),
catching style and security-related issues - things like inconsistent naming, missing security schemes, or
malformed parameter definitions.

The ruleset is a light customization of the official [OWASP API Security Top 10] Spectral ruleset (vendored under
`spectral/owasp-top10/`), which checks for the kind of API design mistakes behind OWASP's well-known list of API
vulnerability classes - broken authentication, excessive data exposure, security misconfiguration, and so on. This
matters because it's a standardized, actively-maintained set of checks that catches whole categories of security
mistakes before they ever reach a running instance, rather than relying on every contributor to independently
remember them. potto's `spectral/spectral.yaml` extends this base ruleset with:

- a handful of `owasp:api4:2019-*` rules turned off, covering the "Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting" category -
  these require annotating essentially every schema field with explicit `maxLength`/`format`/`maximum`/`maxItems`
  constraints and documenting `429` rate-limit responses, neither of which potto does today
- `array-items` turned off, since the built-in rule doesn't yet recognize `prefixItems` as a valid alternative to
  `items` for describing array contents
- three targeted `overrides` that disable the "endpoint requires authentication" checks for `/login`, `/conformance`,
  and `/health` specifically, since those are meant to be public

[OWASP API Security Top 10]: https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/

!!! note "The rate-limiting and constraint rules are meant to come back"

    The `owasp:api4:2019-*` rules are turned off because potto doesn't yet declare resource limits or rate
    limiting, not because they don't matter - lack of both is itself an OWASP API Security Top 10 category. As
    development progresses and potto adds schema-level size/format constraints and rate limiting, these rules
    will be re-enabled in the near future rather than staying off indefinitely - tracked in
    [geobeyond/potto#48](https://github.com/geobeyond/potto/issues/48).

To run it yourself against the dev stack, first make sure it's running (see [Installation]), then:

```shell
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli
docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    exec -T potto uv run potto openapi export > potto_openapi_dev.json
spectral lint -F info -r spectral/spectral.yaml potto_openapi_dev.json
```

Or, since the OpenAPI document is also served dynamically, point spectral straight at the running instance instead:

```shell
spectral lint -r spectral/spectral.yaml http://localhost:3001/api/openapi.json
```

!!! note

    Installing spectral locally requires Node.js. Check the
    [spectral installation docs](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/b8391e051b7d8-installation) for detail.

## ogcapi-registry: conformance validation

Declaring an OGC API conformance class is easy - actually implementing everything it requires is another matter.
`potto openapi validate` uses the [ogcapi-registry] library to fetch a running instance's `/openapi.json` and
`/conformance` documents and cross-check that the OpenAPI document really implements what the server claims to
conform to.

To run it yourself against the dev stack (already running - see [Installation]):

```shell
docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    exec -ti \
    uv run potto openapi validate
```

This defaults to validating `http://localhost:3001/api`, matching the dev stack's published port. Pass
`--potto-api-base-url` to point it elsewhere.

## ogc-cite-runner: official OGC test suites

[ogc-cite-runner] runs the official OGC CITE (Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation) test suites via
TeamEngine. This is the most thorough of the three checks - it exercises a live instance the same way the official
OGC compliance program would, and is the closest thing to ground truth on whether potto actually implements a
given OGC API standard.

!!! tip "TeamEngine docker image"

    potto uses the `ogccite/teamengine-beta` docker image as opposed to `ogccite/teamengine-production` because it
    contains newer versions of the OGC test suites. This also means the TeamEngine URL ends with `/te2` instead of
    `/teamengine`.

The dev stack (see [Installation]) has a dedicated `cite` [docker compose profile] with everything wired up: a
`cite-db` isolated from the regular `db`/`test-db` data, a `potto-cite-bootstrap` one-shot service that migrates
`cite-db` and seeds it via `potto cite-testing bootstrap-ogcapi-features-1`, a `potto-cite` server configured for
CITE testing, and `ogc-teamengine` itself. Bring it up with:

```shell
CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
    docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    --profile cite \
    up --watch --build potto-cite ogc-teamengine
```

!!! note "Naming `potto-cite` and `ogc-teamengine` explicitly"

    `--profile cite` alone would also start the regular `potto`/`db`/`test-db` services from the default dev
    stack, since services without a `profiles` entry always start regardless of which profile is passed - naming
    `potto-cite` (which pulls in its own dependencies, `cite-db` and the one-shot `potto-cite-bootstrap`) and
    `ogc-teamengine` avoids that. It also keeps `--watch` scoped to a service that actually has a `develop.watch`
    block: `potto-cite-runner` doesn't, so naming *it* instead makes compose report `Watch disabled` the moment
    its one-off run finishes.

This stays attached and, just like the regular dev stack, syncs local `src/potto` changes into `potto-cite` -
picked up automatically by uvicorn's `--reload`, since `potto-cite` runs with `POTTO__DEBUG=true`. Press Ctrl-C
when you're done; that only stops `potto-cite` and `ogc-teamengine` - `cite-db` keeps running (tear the whole
profile down as shown below).

With that up, run the CITE test suite against it from another terminal, whenever you want a report:

```shell
CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
    docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    --profile cite \
    run --rm --no-deps potto-cite-runner
```

This prints the CITE run's pass/fail report (`--with-failed` is passed to `ogc-cite-runner` so failure detail is
included) and exits with a non-zero status if any test failed - that's `ogc-cite-runner` reporting genuine
conformance findings, not a sign that the setup itself is broken. Re-run it as often as you like while you
iterate on the code; `--no-deps` skips re-checking the already-running dependencies (including re-running the
one-shot `potto-cite-bootstrap` job) and just re-executes the test suite against your latest changes.

Tear the whole `cite` profile down with:

```shell
docker compose --env-file docker/local.env -f docker/compose.dev.yaml --profile cite down
```

!!! warning "Don't add `-v` to the command above"

    `docker compose down -v` removes **every** named volume declared in `compose.dev.yaml`, not just the ones
    belonging to the `cite` profile - `--profile` only scopes which containers get torn down, not which volumes
    get removed. Running it here would also wipe your regular `db`/`test-db` data. To drop only `cite-db`'s data,
    remove that one volume by name instead:

    ```shell
    docker volume rm potto_cite-db
    ```

??? tip "Poking at things manually"

    `potto-cite` and `ogc-teamengine` also publish host ports, in case you want to inspect either directly while
    the `cite` profile is up (e.g. right before `potto-cite-runner` would run, or after it exits since neither
    `potto-cite` nor `ogc-teamengine` are `--rm`):

    - potto's CITE-testing instance: <http://localhost:3002/api>
    - TeamEngine's own web UI: <http://localhost:59080/te2>

    You can also swap `--with-failed` for other `ogc-cite-runner` report flags - `--output-format json|markdown`,
    `--with-summary`, `--with-passed` - by overriding the `potto-cite-runner` command, e.g.:

    ```shell
    CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
        docker compose \
        --env-file docker/local.env \
        -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
        --profile cite \
        run --rm --no-deps potto-cite-runner \
        uv run ogc-cite-runner execute-test-suite http://ogc-teamengine:8080/te2 \
        ogcapi-features-1.0 --suite-input iut http://potto-cite:3001/api \
        --with-summary --output-format markdown
    ```

??? info "Running it by hand, outside the dev compose stack"

    If you're not using the dev compose stack, or want to point `ogc-cite-runner` at some other running instance,
    you can still launch TeamEngine and a suitably-configured potto process yourself:

    ```shell
    # pull TeamEngine docker image
    docker pull ogccite/teamengine-beta:1.0-SNAPSHOT

    # launch it
    docker run \
        --rm \
        --detach \
        --name=teamengine \
        --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
        --publish=9080:8080 \
        ogccite/teamengine-beta:1.0-SNAPSHOT

    # have at least one public collection
    uv run potto cite-testing bootstrap-ogcapi-features-1

    # launch potto with a suitable configuration
    POTTO__COLLECTION_MANAGER__SETTINGS_MODEL__DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://potto:pottopass@localhost:55432/potto" \
        POTTO__SERVER_METADATA_MANAGER__SETTINGS_MODEL__DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://potto:pottopass@localhost:55432/potto" \
        POTTO__USER_ACCOUNT_MANAGER__SETTINGS_MODEL__DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://potto:pottopass@localhost:55432/potto" \
        POTTO__BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
        POTTO__PUBLIC_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3001 \
        POTTO__USE_OAS30_FIXES=true \
        uv run potto run-server

    # use ogc-cite-runner
    # in this example we are testing OGC API - Features
    uv run ogc-cite-runner execute-test-suite http://localhost:9080/te2 \
        ogcapi-features-1.0 \
        --suite-input iut http://host.docker.internal:3001/api \
        --with-failed
    ```

    The URL of the implementation under test (the `iut` suite input) is `http://host.docker.internal:3001/api`.
    Together with the `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag used when starting the TeamEngine
    container, this lets the running TeamEngine instance see services running on the docker host's network. Check
    the [docker engine docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#add-host) for more
    detail. This networking dance isn't needed with the dev compose `cite` profile above, since `potto-cite` and
    `ogc-teamengine` are both plain services on the same compose network and can just address each other by
    service name.
