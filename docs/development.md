# Development

## Quickstart

potto's recommended dev workflow is fully container-based: `docker compose` builds the potto image, starts it
and its dependencies , and syncs local source code changes live into the running container.

!!! note

    This is the recommended setup, not the only one. If you'd rather run PostgreSQL and the potto server directly
    on your host, you can do so - just adapt the environment variables described in `src/potto/config.py`
    accordingly. The rest of this guide assumes the container-based workflow.

1.  Create a `docker/local.env` file (gitignored, one per machine) pointing at wherever you keep your local
    development data:

    ```shell
    echo 'POTTO_DATA_ROOT="/path/to/your/local/data/directory"' > docker/local.env
    ```

2.  Start the stack:

    ```shell
    CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') \
        CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
        docker compose \
            --env-file docker/local.env \
            -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
            up --watch --build
    ```

    potto is now available at <http://localhost:3001>. See [Rebuilding the docker image] for details on how
    code changes get picked up while the stack is running.

## Contribution guidelines

Read the contribution guidelines, to be added...


## Setup

Contributing to potto requires a couple of pre-requisites to be met. You should be running a linux distribution.
Development might also be possible on other OS, but you'll be mostly on your own with regard to how to set up your
working environment. Additionally, the following tools need to be installed on your machine:

-  [git]
-  [pre-commit]
-  [uv]
-  [Docker] and [docker compose]

Please refer to each tool's own documentation for how to get it installed.

The potto-provided docker compose file takes care of running [PostgreSQL]/[PostGIS] (both a `db` and a `test-db`
service) as well as the potto server itself, so there is no need to install those separately.

## Workflow

If you are not a core committer to potto, be sure to always open an issue that describes the problem,
feature or changes you'd like to materialize. This will provide visibility and give the potto devs
a chance to offer some feedback. If you don't do this, there is a risk that your work will be refused.

!!! warning

    Just in case you skipped the previous paragraph - **the potto team does not accept PRs without
    a corresponding issue**.

potto's code is developed by following the [forking workflow] collaboration strategy. In short:

1. As mentioned above, start by opening an issue describing the problem. Ideally, you'd get some feedback from
   the potto devs before you start working on it
2. Fork potto's repo
3. Clone your fork locally
4. Create a new branch
5. Make changes to the code and add relevant tests
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) to get the changes integrated into the main potto repository
7. Monitor the status of the CI workflow and ensure it passes

    !!! warning

        There is a high likelyhood that potto team will not consider your PR if its associated CI workflow is not
        passing.

8. Follow the PR review process, responding to any comments or change requests
9. Rejoice when your PR is finally merged :smile: :tada:

## Installation

After having `git clone`d your fork of the potto repository and having set up both `origin` and `upstream`
remotes:

1.  Create a `docker/local.env` file (gitignored, one per machine) pointing at wherever you keep your local
    development data:

    ```shell
    echo 'POTTO_DATA_ROOT="/path/to/your/local/data/directory"' > docker/local.env
    ```

2.  Start the dev stack - this builds the potto image, brings up `db` and `test-db`, and starts the potto server
    itself, syncing local source code changes into the running container:

    ```shell
    CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
        docker compose --env-file docker/local.env -f docker/compose.dev.yaml up --watch --build
    ```

3.  Install the [pre-commit] hooks:

    ```shell
    pre-commit install
    ```

    These will ensure that your code is properly formatted and perform some basic linting and static analysis whenever
    you try to commit changes.

4.  Install potto with [uv]. This is needed for host-side tooling, such as tests and linters, even though the
    potto server itself now runs inside a container:

    ```shell
    uv sync --group dev
    ```

5.  Use the `potto` CLI to initialize the database, running it inside the already-running `potto` container so it
    picks up the right database connection settings automatically:

    ```shell
    docker compose \
        --env-file docker/local.env \
        -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
        exec potto uv run potto postgis-manager upgrade
    ```

    !!! note

        `--env-file docker/local.env` is required here too, even though the container is already running - it's
        needed for `docker compose` itself to resolve `POTTO_DATA_ROOT` when it re-reads the compose file to
        find the `potto` service.

You are now ready to start working on the code. potto is available at <http://localhost:3001>.


## Using the potto CLI

Since the development workflow happens inside a running docker compose stack, you need to prefix commands that are
targeting the potto CLI with the appropriate docker-related incantation. Moreover, because potto also uses uv, it
also needs to be part of the incantation:

```shell
docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    exec -ti potto \
    uv run \
    potto <cli-command>
```

The benefit of this is being able to enjoy a fully isolated local development setup.

You can also just get a shell inside the running container:

```shell
docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    exec -ti potto bash
```


## Rebuilding the docker image

Usually potto's development docker images are built remotely, when the continuous integration pipeline is run.
This process is triggered everytime the source code repository's `main` branch has changes merged in. The newly built
image is then pushed to potto's docker registry at ghcr.io/geobeyond/potto/potto.

While the dev stack is running with `--watch` (as shown in [Installation]), most day-to-day changes are handled
automatically: `src/potto` is synced live, and changes to `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` (for example, after
running `uv add` to bring in a new dependency) trigger an automatic rebuild.

The one case `--watch` doesn't cover is changes to `docker/Dockerfile` itself, since it isn't a watched path. If
you edit the `Dockerfile`, force a rebuild yourself with:

```shell
CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
    docker compose --env-file docker/local.env -f docker/compose.dev.yaml build potto
```

The built image is tagged after the current `git` branch (slashes are replaced with `-`, since docker image tags
cannot contain them). Use it only during your own local development.

[Installation]: #installation


## Code formatting and static analysis

The pre-commit hook uses [ruff] and [ty] to format the code and perform linting and static analysis. These tools also
run in CI and you can run them yourself with:

```shell
uv run ruff format --check
uv run ruff check
uv run ty check
```

[ruff]: https://astral.sh/ruff
[ty]: https://docs.astral.sh/ty/


## Running tests

potto uses [pytest] for testing. The production `potto` image does not install the `dev` dependency group . Testing
instead runs through two dedicated containers, each built from the `potto` image
(via [docker compose additional_contexts]), with just what that kind of testing needs layered on top.
Both are behind their own [docker compose profile], so neither is part of the default dev stack.

[docker compose profile]: https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/profiles/
[docker compose additional_contexts]: https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/build/#additional_contexts

Non-e2e tests (unit and integration) run via the `potto-test` service (profile `test`), which layers on
`uv sync --group dev`. `tests/` is synced live via `--watch` (same as `src/potto`), so edits to test files are
picked up without a rebuild:

```shell
CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') \
    CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
    docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    --profile test \
    run --rm potto-test

# only run the integration tests
CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-') \
    CURRENT_GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
    docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    --profile test run --rm \
    potto-test uv run pytest -m integration
```

End-to-end tests use [playwright] and run via the `potto-e2e` service (profile `e2e`), which layers on the same
`uv sync --group dev` plus Playwright's browser and its OS-level dependencies.

The container is self-contained:
it spins up its own throwaway `potto run-server` process and a headless browser internally, both talking only to
`test-db`.

```shell
docker compose \
    --env-file docker/local.env \
    -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
    --profile e2e \
    run --rm potto-e2e
```

??? tip "Watching a test run headed"

    By default the browser runs headless inside the container. To watch it run with a real, visible browser
    window, forward your X11 display into the container as one-off flags (this is opt-in per run, not part of
    the service's default config):

    ```shell
    xhost +local:docker   # once per session: let containers reach your X server

    docker compose \
        --env-file docker/local.env \
        -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
        --profile e2e \
        run --rm \
        -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
        potto-e2e uv run pytest -m e2e --headed
    ```

    `xhost +local:docker` loosens X access control for local Unix-socket clients - reasonable on a single-user
    dev machine, but worth being aware of.

??? tip "Getting a Playwright trace for a failed run"

    Traces are wired into fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`, gated behind pytest-playwright's
    `--tracing` flag (off by default), and written to `test-results/`, which is bind-mounted from the repo root
    so files survive after the (ephemeral, `--rm`) container exits:

    ```shell
    docker compose \
        --env-file docker/local.env \
        -f docker/compose.dev.yaml \
        --profile e2e \
        run --rm \
        potto-e2e uv run pytest -m e2e --tracing=retain-on-failure
    ```

    Open the resulting `test-results/*-trace.zip` at <https://trace.playwright.dev> - Playwright's web-based
    trace viewer.

### API linting and compliance testing

Beyond this test suite, potto's OpenAPI document and running instances are also checked with spectral,
ogcapi-registry, and ogc-cite-runner - see [API compliance testing] for what each does and how to run them
against the dev stack.

The OGC CITE suite has its own profile-gated service too, `potto-cite-runner` (profile `cite`), alongside a
dedicated `cite-db`, `potto-cite-bootstrap` and `potto-cite` server - see [API compliance testing] for the
one-line command that brings the whole thing up and runs it.
