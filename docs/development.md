# Development

## Quickstart

```shell
# start the docker compose stack
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml up -d --force-recreate

# set some env variables
export PYGEOAPI_ROOT="wherever-you-cloned-pygeoapi-repo"
POTTO__DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://potto:pottopass@localhost:55432/potto"
export POTTO__DEBUG=true
export POTTO__PYGEOAPI_CONFIG_FILE=pygeoapi-config-example.yml
export POTTO__RELOAD_DIRS=$(pwd -P)
export POTTO__UVICORN_LOG_CONFIG_FILE=uvicorn-log-config-example.yml

# start the server
uv run potto run-server
```

## Setup

Contributing to potto requires a couple of pre-requisites to be met:

You should be running a linux distribution. Development might also be possible on other OS, but you'll be mostly
on your own with regard to how to set up your working environment

Additionally, the following tools need to be installed on your machine:

-  [git]
-  [pre-commit]
-  [uv]

Please refer to each tool's own documentation for how to get it installed

Finally, a [PostgreSQL] database with [PostGIS] installed. You can either use the potto-provided [docker compose]
file, which is suitable for development and includes a `db` service or install PostgreSQL and PostGIS in
whatever way you prefer and then create a database to be used for development.

[git]: https://git-scm.com/

[PostGIS]: https://postgis.net/

[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/


## Workflow

If you are not a core committer to potto, be sure to always open an issue that describes the problem,
feature or changes you'd like to materialize. This will provide visibility and give the potto devs
a chance to offer some feedback. If you don't do this, there is a risk that your work will be refused.

!!! warning

    Just in case you skipped the previous paragraph - **the potto team does not accept PRs without
    a corresponding issue**.

potto's code is developed by following the [forking workflow] collaboration strategy. In short:

1. Fork potto's repo
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch
4. Make changes to the code
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) to get the changes integrated into the main potto repository
6. Follow the PR review process, responding to any comments or change requests
7. Rejoice when your PR is merged :smile: :tada:

## Installation

After having `git clone`d your fork of the potto repository and having set up both `origin` and `upstream`
remotes:

1.  Have your database up and running. If you are using the docker compose file that comes with the potto repository,
    you can run:

    ```shell
    docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yaml up -d
    ```

2.  Ensure you have these environment variables set:

    ```shell
    PYGEOAPI_ROOT="/datadisk/dev/pygeoapi"
    POTTO__DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<password>@localhost:<port>/<db>"
    POTTO__TEST_DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://potto:pottopass@localhost:55433/potto_test"
    POTTO__DEBUG="true"
    POTTO__UVICORN_LOG_CONFIG_FILE="/datadisk/dev/potto/uvicorn-log-config-no-db.yml"
    ```

    A good strategy is to create a `potto-dev.env` file with the variables and then load it:

    ```shell
    set -o allexport; source potto-dev.env; set +o allexport
    ```

3.  Install the [pre-commit] hooks:

    ```shell
    pre-commit install
    ```

    These will ensure that your code is properly formatted and perform some basic linting and static analysis whenever
    you try to commit changes.

4.  Install potto with [uv]:

    ```shell
    uv sync --group dev
    ```

6.  Use the `potto` CLI to initialize the database

    ```uv run potto db upgrade```


You are now ready to start working on the code.

5.  Use the `potto` CLI to start the potto web application server:

    ```uv run potto run-server```


## Running tests

potto uses [pytest] and running the tests requires the existence of an additional database.

1.  Ensure you define the `POTTO__TEST_DATABASE_DSN` environment variable. Create this test database and then put
    this in your `potto-dev.env` file:

    ```shell
    POTTO__TEST_DATABASE_DSN="postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<password>@localhost:<port>/<db>"
    ```

    !!! note

        Don't forget to export the contents of your `potto-dev.env` file before running the tests

2.  Run tests with:

    ```shell
    uv run pytest
    ```
