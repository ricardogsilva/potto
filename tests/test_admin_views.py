"""Smoke tests for the starlette-admin views in managers/postgis/admin/.

These views had no test coverage at all before the BaseModelView refactor (which
removed the SQLAlchemy-contrib base they used to depend on) - this module exercises
find_all/find_by_pk/count/serialize/can_create/can_edit/can_delete against each,
enough to catch the kind of issue the refactor surfaced (ServerMetadataModelView's
primary key handling relied on the SQLA-contrib base tolerating a missing attribute).
The configuration-file manager's read-only CollectionView is covered separately in
tests/test_manager_configurationfile.py.
